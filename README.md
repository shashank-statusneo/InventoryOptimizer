## Project Structure

* Consider using Material UI to design componets (find reference [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/))
* Create and use modules, For example `\services\auth.js` for localStorage for auth managment
* Create and Use application hooks in `\hooks\*` folder
* Test you componets and create snapshot for it. Find some tests into `__test__\*` folder
* Consume application store to manage data `\redux` (find reference [here](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started))
    * Define actions and respective reducers for that actions `\redux\actions\*` and `\redux\reduces\*`
    * Dispatch different actions from componets and Consume different states from their reducers
